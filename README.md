# Description
The Dark-er Forest is a multi-user dungeon crawler. The user will first create an account with a custom character by selecting a name , race, and class. This application is meant to excite the user by throwing them straight into a mysterious, whimsical, and thrilling adventure into the fictional world of the Dark-er Forst. The user is prompted with options for different action like entering and exiting rooms, fighting monsters, and how they'd like to deliver their attacks. Attack damage is calcualted but a simulated dice roll and characters lose health points as monsters fight back. As the user crawls through the dungeon they pick up loot and kill monsters to ultimately be the player with the most loot and monsters conquered by the end of the game.
